This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys.  When you use a non-integer value as an array key, PHP will implicitly cast it to a string. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful about the type of your keys.

```php
<?php
$data = [];
$data[1] = 'one';
$data[true] = 'true';
$data[1.0] = 'one point zero';
$data['1'] = 'one as string';
echo count($data); // outputs 3, not 4
print_r($data); // Shows that 1, true, and 1.0 are all treated as string keys
?>
```

The problem is that `1`, `true`, and `1.0` all convert to the string key '1'. This can create issues in scenarios where you expect unique keys based on their data types.  For instance, retrieving `$data[true]` returns 'one as string' which might not be the expected behavior.
